This is a joint project between Timo Toots and the Univerity of Tartu.

The team is made up of four students:
* Andri Parvelo
* Sander Mikelsaar
* Bruno Produit
* Anton Å½atkin

Currently the open data of Estonia is scattered around the web in many different servers and data formats which makes it difficult to use many data sources in a single project.
The goal of the team is to use and extend the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) to collect, organise and store Estonian open data and make it accessible from one place in a consistent and reliable matter.
CKAN is a web-based open source management system for the storage and distribution of open data. Its codebase is maintained by Open Knowledge International and it's widely used by governments throughout the world to manage open data.

Here you can see the approximate structure of the software:
